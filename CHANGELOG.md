# Changelog — APS Conecta Gestión

Every version a clinic can install. `main` is the development trunk; a release is a tag, and a clinic
installs a tag ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-gestion-is-the-development-trunk.md)).

Format: [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each version links to its GitHub release, which holds the full notes. The pinned app versions and
image digests live there and are deliberately not copied here — one fact, one owner.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Documentation consistency pass across the organisation. Org-wide decisions now live in this
  repository and are referenced by absolute URL rather than by a path that depended on where someone
  cloned things ([ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-org-wide-facts-live-in-gestion.md)); the organisation
  publishes only the generic half of its shared documents
  ([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-only-the-generic-half-is-published-as-an-org-default.md)); and the
  consequences ADR-0010 recorded when it moved the organisation to AGPL-3.0-or-later are now carried
  through every document that had gone on describing the code as proprietary.

### Removed

- **No establishment ships with the product any more.** `sites/los-castanos/site.sh` and the
  generated `themes/apsconecta/core/css/site.css` are no longer tracked: both are per-install
  artifacts, and the repository promised in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` to name no establishment
  while shipping a real one as the suggested default. A fresh clone now stops at "choose your
  establishment" and you pick one from the DEIS register with `scripts/deis.py`.

  **Before updating an existing working copy, copy your `sites/<slug>/` somewhere outside the
  repository.** Taking this change deletes the previously-tracked site file from your working tree.
  Restore it afterwards — it is ignored from now on, and `make install` converges exactly as before.

### Fixed

- `docs/LICENSING.md` §4.3 concluded that our own code "may therefore remain proprietary", citing a
  §1 that ADR-0010 had already reversed. The aggregation analysis survived the relicence; its
  conclusion did not.
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` listed two developers who had never committed and held no access, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` both built on that roster — including a promise to answer
  security reports "as fast as a 3-person team can".

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- `07-certs` re-imported a certificate the bundle already held ([#143](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/issues/143),
  fixed in [#144](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/pull/144)). A container briefly too busy to
  answer looked exactly like a bundle holding nothing, so provisioning performed a *write* on an
  already-provisioned instance and failed the idempotency check in CI. Two defects shared the one
  line: "could not ask" was indistinguishable from "not imported", and the match read a rendered
  table whose column padding meant it was effectively asking which *other* certificates were
  installed. `scripts/test.sh` now carries a behavioural regression check covering both.

Same pinned apps and image digests as 0.1.0 — no functional change for a clinic.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- The first installable release. Before it `git tag` returned nothing: every app was pinned by
  version and sha256 while gestion itself carried no version at all, so a clinic installed whatever
  `main` happened to be that day and a bug report could not name the bytes that produced it
  ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-gestion-is-the-development-trunk.md)).
- Pins six apps — five vendored upstream, plus `epidemiologia` built from a tag of its own
  repository. Nothing contacts the Nextcloud app store at any point: every app ships as a committed
  tarball verified by sha256 ([#98](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/issues/98)). Images are
  pinned by digest rather than tag.
