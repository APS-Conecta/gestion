# Changelog — APS Conecta Gestión

Every version a clinic can install. `main` is the development trunk; a release is a tag, and a clinic
installs a tag ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-gestion-is-the-development-trunk.md)).

Format: [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each version links to its GitHub release, which holds the full notes. The pinned app versions and
image digests live there and are deliberately not copied here — one fact, one owner.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Talk (`spreed` 24.0.5) and Desktop Workspace (`desktop_workspace` 0.18.2) are part of the
  suite**, vendored as pinned tarballs like every other app, so a clean install still needs no
  network and no app store (#98). Two things about Talk are recorded in its `VENDOR` file rather
  than left to be found: it reaches an **external STUN server** (`stun.nextcloud.com:443`) by
  default to discover a caller's own address, and **group calls stay small — around four people —
  without a High Performance Backend**, which this stack does not run. Chat and one-to-one calls are
  unaffected by the second. Talk's tarball is 52 MB, more than every other vendored app put
  together, and git keeps a full copy per bump: it is now the first place to look if this repo has
  to go on a diet. `desktop_workspace` is third-party (`canisdata`), the same posture as
  `side_menu`.

- **The licence table is now gated against the apps themselves.** `scripts/test.sh` reads
  `appinfo/info.xml` out of each vendored tarball — tracked, so it needs no network and no running
  stack — and fails if `docs/LICENSING.md` disagrees or has no row for a vendored app. Nextcloud's
  legacy bare `agpl` normalises to `AGPL-3.0-or-later` rather than failing, since `calendar`,
  `side_menu` and `epidemiologia` still declare it that way. The SPDX column is located by reading
  the header, not by a fixed index: the Source column also contains backticks, and an inserted
  column would otherwise shift the check onto its neighbour. Validated by seeding four cases —
  the original defect, a deleted row, an inserted column, and a table with no SPDX column at all.

### Fixed

- **`docs/LICENSING.md` stated the wrong grant for the Euro-Office connector** (#171). The table
  said `AGPL-3.0-or-later`; `eurooffice`'s own `info.xml` declares **`AGPL-3.0-only`** — materially
  different grants. It survived two documentation audits (#87, #88) and a version bump (#167) that
  edited that exact row without looking one cell to the left. Five rows also still said
  *(occ-installed)*, false since #98 vendored them as tarballs; they now name the pinned version and
  the tarball.

- **`provisioning/apps/calendar/VENDOR` described its own size against an app that was deleted**
  (#172): *"the second largest thing in this repo after maps"*, pointing at maps' file. `maps` was
  dropped in ADR-0005/#142. It is the largest thing in the repo now — 18.9 MB against the next at
  4.7 MB — and the comment says so without naming a sibling that can be dropped again.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains **"What the docs gate does not govern"**, recording that `VENDOR` files,
  `Makefile` comments and code comments are outside `repo-docs`' corpus deliberately, so the
  retirement rule applies to them by review rather than by gate.

- **`provisioning/apps/side_menu/VENDOR` pointed at a source nobody can reach** (#169).
  `gitnet.fr` — deblan's self-hosted forge and the app's only source, with no mirror anywhere —
  resolves and then blackholes the SYN on both 80 and 443 (`http=000`, `time_connect=0.000000`).
  Measured 2026-08-13 and again 2026-09-14, unchanged. Nothing is broken: the 6.0.1 tarball is
  committed, sha-pinned and installs. The file records the outage, that 6.0.1 is pinned
  deliberately, and the three ways out — and a `frozen=` line beside the pin now tells
  `make apps-check` to **report this app without failing on it**, because a red line nobody can act
  on is one everyone learns to ignore, which is what the weekly workflow's own header warns against.
  The app is still listed on every run with the version it cannot take, so the freeze stays
  reviewable; a stale pin on any other app still fails the gate.


### Security

- **Provisioning refuses to run with the secrets this repository publishes.** `make setup` generates
  all four from `/dev/urandom`, so a placeholder only survives a hand-copy of `.env.example` — which
  is what README step 2 used to ask for, and what somebody does when `make setup` refuses because
  `.env` already exists. The result is a clinic whose admin password is readable by anyone who can
  read this repo. `install.sh` and `seed.sh` now stop, naming the keys. What counts as a placeholder
  is read out of `.env.example`, so rewording one does not quietly stop it being one, and a secret
  added there is covered on the day it is added.

### Security

- **The cert phase ran a string an attacker on the network chose.**
  `ensure_aia_intermediate` read a certificate's authorityInfoAccess pointer from a **remote** host
  over an `openssl s_client` handshake that verifies nothing, then interpolated it into a
  `docker compose exec … sh -c "…"`. A single quote closed the literal and the rest was a command —
  demonstrated in a container with `x'; touch /tmp/PWNED; echo '`.

  Neither apparent mitigation held. The `tr -d '[:space:]'` strip does not stop a payload that needs
  no whitespace, and "it is only root inside the container" names the wrong party: the operator
  running `make seed` already holds the docker socket, while **the network** — which otherwise has
  none — was being handed execution in the container that holds the database credentials.

  The pointer and the host now go through the environment, the pattern `ensure_sample_file` already
  used; anything that is not a plain `http(s)` URL of safe characters is refused rather than escaped;
  and the fetched certificate must now chain to a root the container **already trusts**, for a leaf
  that is **for this host** (`openssl verify -untrusted … -verify_hostname`), before it joins
  Nextcloud's trust bundle.

  That last check was got wrong once on the way. `-partial_chain -trusted` proves only that the
  fetched certificate signed the certificate the handshake presented — and an on-path attacker
  chooses both, so it accepted a forged pair in testing. A parse is not a verification, and neither
  is verifying against something the attacker supplied. The pointer and the leaf are also now read
  from a **single** handshake, so the certificate being verified is the one whose pointer was
  followed.

### Changed

- Documentation consistency pass across the organisation. Org-wide decisions now live in this
  repository and are referenced by absolute URL rather than by a path that depended on where someone
  cloned things ([ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-org-wide-facts-live-in-gestion.md)); the organisation
  publishes only the generic half of its shared documents
  ([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-only-the-generic-half-is-published-as-an-org-default.md)); and the
  consequences ADR-0010 recorded when it moved the organisation to AGPL-3.0-or-later are now carried
  through every document that had gone on describing the code as proprietary.

### Removed

- **No establishment ships with the product any more.** `sites/los-castanos/site.sh` and the
  generated `themes/apsconecta/core/css/site.css` are no longer tracked: both are per-install
  artifacts, and the repository promised in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` to name no establishment
  while shipping a real one as the suggested default. A fresh clone now stops at "choose your
  establishment" and you pick one from the DEIS register with `scripts/deis.py`.

  **Before updating an existing working copy, copy your `sites/<slug>/` somewhere outside the
  repository.** Taking this change deletes the previously-tracked site file from your working tree.
  Restore it afterwards — it is ignored from now on, and `make install` converges exactly as before.

### Fixed

- `docs/LICENSING.md` §4.3 concluded that our own code "may therefore remain proprietary", citing a
  §1 that ADR-0010 had already reversed. The aggregation analysis survived the relicence; its
  conclusion did not.
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` listed two developers who had never committed and held no access, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` both built on that roster — including a promise to answer
  security reports "as fast as a 3-person team can".

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- `07-certs` re-imported a certificate the bundle already held ([#143](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/issues/143),
  fixed in [#144](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/pull/144)). A container briefly too busy to
  answer looked exactly like a bundle holding nothing, so provisioning performed a *write* on an
  already-provisioned instance and failed the idempotency check in CI. Two defects shared the one
  line: "could not ask" was indistinguishable from "not imported", and the match read a rendered
  table whose column padding meant it was effectively asking which *other* certificates were
  installed. `scripts/test.sh` now carries a behavioural regression check covering both.

Same pinned apps and image digests as 0.1.0 — no functional change for a clinic.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- The first installable release. Before it `git tag` returned nothing: every app was pinned by
  version and sha256 while gestion itself carried no version at all, so a clinic installed whatever
  `main` happened to be that day and a bug report could not name the bytes that produced it
  ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-gestion-is-the-development-trunk.md)).
- Pins six apps — five vendored upstream, plus `epidemiologia` built from a tag of its own
  repository. Nothing contacts the Nextcloud app store at any point: every app ships as a committed
  tarball verified by sha256 ([#98](https://github.com/APS-Conecta/gestion/issues/98)). Images are
  pinned by digest rather than tag.
