# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring
the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the suite's vocabulary.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

This is a single-context repo: one `CONTEXT.md`, one `docs/adr/`. The `/domain-modeling`
skill adds terms and decisions as they get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a
hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md` rather than drifting to
a synonym.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing
language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for
`/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently
overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0001 (two signing keys), but worth reopening because…_
